Needs the python library pillow installed to run
 
This program was written to improve my Python skills and to actually be of use.
 
My partner has a folder full of pictures of our son and though she started with the
best intentions it had got a little unorganised this program organises files in to
folders for the age of a child based on their date of birth so a picture taken
1 year 2 months after the given date of birth will be in the folder named 14months if
you set the 'For the how many months do you want to switch to years? (e.g. 18 would become 1 year 6 months) -> ' to 24
 
To Use.
 
1) run the program
    *it creates the folders required on the first run*
2) copy some pictures into the newly created Pics_ToSort folder
3) run the program again
4) the pictures will now be in the correctly named folder in the Pics_Sorted folder
